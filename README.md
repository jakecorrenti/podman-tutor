# podman-tutor
An interactive terminal application that holds your hand as you learn how to use Podman to work with containers


## Ideas 

- emulate something similar to that of VimTutor
- have some sort of persistence to store what "stage" the user is on 
- almost have a "home screen" where the user can select to pick up where they left off or start again (which erases their previous progress)
- each stage will go through the basic commands of podman, prompting the user to execute a certain command with an explanation of what it does
- under the prompt, have a live terminal that the user can type into


## Todo 
- [ ] figure out what to use for the tui library
- [ ] figure out how in the world to get a prompt and a working terminal on the same "screen" accessible to the user 
- [ ] figure out the mechanics of how the user will go forward and backwards in the sections in the user interface
